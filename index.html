        <p>Hello world and welcome to my personal website! I am a Delaware resident who is currently studying at Flatiron to 
            learn software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Why did I choose this path? I went to college for a couple years and unfortunately it didn't work out for me,
            so I left and worked in blue collar for a few years. Over the course of the pandemic the work place became very toxic
            and demanding due to supply chain issues and staff shortages. I realized this isn't what I wanted to do for a living
            so I made a concious decision to look for a new opportunity. Enter the world of coding bootcamps.
        </p>
        <p>Why did I choose Flatiron? I made the decision to study here because they are a very reputable institution with a
            profound success rate. Also through discussions with friends and family who work in industry, the course layout gave
            the best range of tools for a beginner fullstack software engineer, especially one who hasn't quite figured out 
            where he'll fit best. Overall I am excited to learn and begin this new path in life.
